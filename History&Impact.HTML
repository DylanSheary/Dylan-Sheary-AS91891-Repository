                        History 
                        <br>
                        After the popularity of the Harpsichord fizzled out in the early 1700s, the modified Zumpe Piano took London by storm as a symbol of not only artistry but of stature, it wasn’t long before the royal family’s musician, John Christian Bach, taught Queen Charlotte how to play the instrument, exploding its popularity even further. It spread around Europe and then the rest of the world throughout the 1800s before rising as a favourite instrument of classical music players and composers. The only thing that could slow its fascinating prosperity and societal popularity was the widespread demand for passive forms of entertainment throughout the 1900s, such as the phonograph or radio. Nevertheless, even today, Grand Pianos are bought as immense musical luxuries, and a doorway into the world of classical music as a whole.

                        Impact
                        <br>
                        As stated in my history section, the piano became a symbol of stature as well as artistic talent, especially so within the middle class during the late  1800s. As the basic elements of the 1900s Western lifestyle spread to the rest of the world, the Grand Piano followed, boosting domestic musical culture forth and showing it to the world.
                        <br>
                        It is no wonder that the instrument still holds such a bold connection to people’s love of music and music composition in the hearts of modern musicians.
